# Capstone Static Website Deployment

This repository contains automation scripts and the static website for the Capstone Project.
- `deploy_infra.sh` — creates Resource Group, VNet, and Subnets on Azure.
- `deploy_vm.sh` — (to be added) creates VM(s) and passes cloud-init.
- `cloud-init.txt` — (to be added) bootstraps the VM to install nginx and pull the website.
- `website/` — (to be added) folder for index.html, style.css, and assets.

## Goal
Deploy a unique static website to an Azure Linux VM using Azure CLI scripts. Document steps and provide screenshots.
